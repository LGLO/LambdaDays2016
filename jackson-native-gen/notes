Workflow:
Edit 'types.properties'.
Run frege-gen-native tool..
Cut interesting parts from 'generated-sources' and paste to file.
Delete what does not compile and is not essential.
Change order of exceptions, because of "has already been caught" error.
Refine return type:
  native reader :: Mutable s ObjectMapper -> ST s t
  to:
  native reader :: Mutable s ObjectMapper -> ST s ObjectReader
Change ObjectReader.readTree to pure (for String only) and get rid of ST.
